    <h3>About Me </h3>
    <p> My name is Matlain Marano, however many call me Mattie. I am originally
      from Chester, New Jersey, but I am currently living in Coral Gables,
       Florida where I am a student at the University of Miami. I am currently
       studying to get a BBA in Marketing and Minors in Public Relations and
       Interactive Media. After graduation, I hope to get a job in either a Marketing or Public
      Relations agency where I can work on social media campaigns for clients. My dream job,
    which would combine many of my interests into one, would be to work for the Olympic Committee.</p>

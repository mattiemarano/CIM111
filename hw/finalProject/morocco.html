      <h2>My Favorite Memories</h2>

            <p class="memory-title">A New Perspective</p>
            <p class="memory1">One of my favorite memories, not only from Morocco but in general, is when I spent the night sleeping under the stars in the Sahara Desert. As the sun was beginning to set, we all mounted our camels and rode off into the dunes.
               After the bumpy,
               and slightly uncomfortable ride, we stopped for the night at a Bedoin camp. That night we were meant to all sleep in tents at the camp site, but instead a bunch of us decided to drag our mattresses over a dune right outside of camp and sleep in
               the sand under the stars. That night it was July 4th, so we all started singing the star spangled banner and spent the whole night laughing and talking. After everyone began to drift off to sleep, I finally realized what I was doing. I was lying
               on the sand in the Sahara Desert of Morocco with ten people I had met only days before. With sand and stars for miles in every direction, the world seemed to be much bigger and I started to feel marginally smaller. However, in that early morning
               moment I realized that it is ok not feel like I have found my place in the world yet. There are over seven billion people on Earth and nearly 200 countries, and it would have been easy to let that moment become overwhelming, or disheartening,
               but
               it was actually the opposite. This moment truly changed my perspective on the world and my place in it.

            <p class="memory-title">Break-fast</p>
            <p class="memory2">The timing of my trip to Morocco happened to overlap with Ramadan, a holy month in the Islamic calendar, observed by Muslims worldwide. During Ramadan Muslims focus greatly on fasting, prayer, reflection, and community. The
               effects of Ramadan
               could be seen throughout the country; stores being open during odd hours, life moving slower because people were fasting, and locals taking more time out of their days to pray. One night, when we were staying in a small village near the Atlas
               Mountains, we joined a local family for Iftar. Iftar, or "break-fast" is the meal that Muslims eat once the sun sets during Ramadan, effectively being their first meal of the day when they finally get to break fasting until the next morning.
               Despite not fasting ourselves, it was a super special moment to be able to join in on such an important cultural and religous practice for Muslims. This moment made me feel much more connected to the people of Morocco and allowed us to immerse
               ourselves further into the culture.</p>

         <section>
            <p class="memory-title">Marrakesh Mahem</p>
            <p class="memory3">Marrakesh is like no other city I have been to before. The closest comparison I can make is to the busy streets of New York City, but that does not even do it justice. The main medina of Marrakesh, essentially the city center,
               is
               bustling with
               activity, both day and night. There are hundreds of vendors trying to sell locals and tourists their goods, and I can almost garuntee that whatever you want or need, you can find. There are wooden sculptures, leather bags, jewlerys, food,
               lanterns, and everything in between. Once you are done walking through the vendors of the square, you can delve deeper into the souks, which can be very intimidating. I remember walking through the winding streets, each vendor trying to sell me
               anything and everything they had. This was a shopping experience like none other I had ever expereinced. One aspect that was very interesting was the bartering system; I remember specifically wanted to buy a gift from my brothers but it was a
               little out of my price range. The store owner and I went back and forth until I decided it wasn't worth it, and as I was about to leave, he dropped his price. </p>

         <img class="moments-photos photo4" src="photos/morocco/hike_2.jpg" alt="ripped pants">
         <section>
            <p class="memory-title">Fashion Fail</p>
            <p class="memory4">On one of the days of my trip we were visiting the town of Tinghir, located in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. After lunch one day we embarked on a short hike through the Todra Gorge. While in Morocco, our group tried to
               be
               as respectful
               to the culture as we could, and this meant that we dressed appropriatley. Essentially, we were not allowed to have our shoulders exposed, and we had to wear long pants which were not form fitted. Left with few options, for the majority of the
               trip
               I wore flowly, hareem style pants. This fashion choice did not prove to a problem until the day of our hike. While on the hike I attempted to take a step up, and in that moment I heard a rip. I didn't think much of it in the moment. However, as
               we
               continued to trek on, I started to feel a breeze on my back side. Confused, I put my hand to my back, and where I should've felt pants, I felt skin. Luckily, a girl on the trip, Eve, had a scarf on, and she kindly allowed me to use it to
               maintain
               my modesty. For the rest of the hike I wore the scarf as a skirt and it all worked out in the end. Instead of throwing out those pants after the incident, I kept them to bring home with me to show people how ripped they truly were. </p>

         <section>
            <p class="memory-title">Paint Splatter</p>
            <p class="memory5">When I traveled to Costa Rica, a majority of the time spent on that trip was spent doing community service, or planning to complete the service. On the Moroccan Wander trip however, there was more of a focus on expereincing
               everything that
               Morocco had to offer, meaning that we traveled all around the country. While many aspects of the trip were about adventuring around, or seeing what the country had to offer, another important aspect was a service component. While were visiting
               the
               village near the Atlas Mountains, we went to a local school that Rustic Pathways had been buidling. At this point the structure was completed, which left our group to paint. Since it was Ramadan, and the locals were not able to eat or drink
               throughout the day, we did not work for many hours, but we were able to finish painting the exterior of the school. As we worked, local children came and watched us. One child was particularly interested in what we were doing, and began helping
               us
               paint. Not too long after starting the painting, he lost interest in painting the school and started painting himself and us instead. The pure joy and happiness he was experiencing was enough to make the extra paint splaters on my pants worth
               it.

            <p class="memory-title">The Perfect(ish) Group</p>
            <p class="memory6">In all honesty, its moments like these that make me wish that I was more thoughtful while traveling and that I journaled, or kept record of what happens on my trips. While in Morocco I know that there were countless funny
               moments, all which I
               wish I could recall now, but they have disappeared out of my memory. Despite this, I still wanted to make sure that I finally made note of how amazing this trip was, in part because of the people I was with. When traveling with a group of 14
               random strangers, it is highly likely that everyone will not get along, especially since we are all from different walks of life. In reality, these differences made everything more interesting, allowing us to learn from one another. Was
               everything
               always perfect and amazing, no, becasue that is just not realistic. But that is not to say that I would change any of the moments of this trip. For every low point of the trip, where things were not peachy and perfect, there were five of those
               amazing moments to balance it out. Without the other 13 people on my trip, it would not have been the same expereince at all. Shoutout to Jack, Ahmed, Ian, Jono, Yaniv, Josh, Sebastain, Eve, Emma, Grayson, Kathryne, Kinnari, and Tati for two
               weeks
               of
               adventure.</p>

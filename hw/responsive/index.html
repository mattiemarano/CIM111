      <hr>


      <p>Rome, Italy's capital, is a sprawling, cosmopolitatn city with nearly 3000 years of globally influential art, architecture and culture on display. Once the capital of an ancient republic and empire whose armies and polity defined the Western world in antiquity and left seemingly indelible imprints thereafter, the spiritual and physical seat of the Roman Catholic Church, and the site of major pinnacles of artistic and intellectual achievement, Rome is the Eternal City, remaining today a political capital, a religious centre, and a memorial to the creative imagination of the past.</p>
